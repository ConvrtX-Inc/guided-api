But by the time you get to level 20, there are ads every 2 levels. Around level 26 or so, I got an ad after just one level... And the ads are long, a video and then a timed still. Just... Way too much for me. And while I don't mind paying for apps that I like, this costs twice as much as I am willing to pay for this kind of app. I'm uninstalling it. Sigh","I understand the need for ads for a free game. Starting out, every 4-5 levels you get an ad. Ok, not bad, definitely playable. Starting at level 40, however, you get an ad EVERY. SINGLE. LEVEL. The ads take longer to sit through than the level takes to solve. So, sadly, even though it's fun for a bit, getting more ads than cable TV, I uninstalled.","There's not really any problem. It's a good mobile game that requires some revenue (that's free to download, mind you) so it sets me up with some ads. And if I wanted to go premium I'd pay the $5.99 a month. After all, it's not like other games, this has a lot of work put into it, work that requires fruitful compensation. Have fun and keep trying!","Too many and too long ads especially those that required changing the screen orientation. played for about 30 minutes and was still in elementary school kevel words. I downloaded the game because of the ad that showed seven letters and asked how many words you could form from them. That was not what the game was at all at least through level 20. The Instagram ad ran after each of the last few levels for about 30 seconds and then the x to get out was so small I could not select it on my Slate.","Just started playing and love it so far. No timing or being rushed. Seems to be not so difficult to play and helps keep my mind working on something besides worrying. Really think I am going to enjoy very much. Anyone who likes word games should try it, can always delete if not for you!"],"editorsChoice":false,"features":[],"appId":"com.fugo.wow","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fugo.wow&hl=en&gl=us"}
